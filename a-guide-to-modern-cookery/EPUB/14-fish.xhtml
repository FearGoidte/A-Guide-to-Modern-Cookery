		<h1>Chapter XIV <span epub:type="title">Fish</span></h1>
		<p><span class="first-words">In</span> matters culinary, fish comprise not only the vertebrates of the sea and river, but also the esculent Crustacea, mollusca, and chelonia, and one batrachian. Of course, the animals representing these various classes differ enormously in respect of their importance as articles of diet. Fresh-water fish, for instance, with the exception of salmon and some kinds of trout, are scarcely ever eaten in England; and the same applies to the frog. As regards salt-water fish, although certain species, such as the sole and the turbot, are in great demand, many other and excellent ones which are looked upon as inferior are seldom put into requisition by first-class cookery. Thus, <em>Brill</em>, <em>Red Mullet</em>, and <em>Bass</em> are not nearly so popular as they deserve to be, and never appear on a menu of any importance. No doubt. Fashion—ever illogical and wayward—exercises her tyrannical sway here, as in other matters of opinion; for it will be found, even when the distinctions among fish are once established, that there exist a host of incongruities in the un-written law. Fresh cod is a case in point; should this fish appear on the menu of a grand dinner given by Royalty, the guests would not think it at all out of place; but if the chef of a large modern hotel ventured to include it among the items of a plain table-d’hôte dinner he would most probably incur the scorn and indignation of his clientèle.</p>
		<p>This example, than which none could be better suited to our case, successfully shows that the culinary value of the fish has far less to do with the vogue the latter enjoys than the very often freakish whims of the public.</p>
		<p>One can but deplore the arbitrary proscription which so materially reduces the resources at the disposal of a cook, more particularly at a time when the universally imperious cry is for novelty and variety in dishes and menus respectively; and one can only hope that reason and good sense may, at no remote period, intervene to check the purposeless demands of both entertainers and their guests in this respect.</p>
		<p>Having regard to these considerations, I have omitted from this work, which is really a thesaurus of selected recipes and not a complete formulary, all those fish enumerated below, which are very rarely eaten in England, and the recipes for which could therefore serve no purpose:—</p>
		<h2 id="753" class="formula">Shad</h2>
		<p>Chiefly served grilled.</p>
		<h2 id="754" class="formula">Fresh Anchovies</h2>
		<p>Extremely rare, and may be grilled or fried.</p>
		<h2 id="755" class="formula">Eels</h2>
		<p>Considered as common, and principally used in the preparation of a pie held in high esteem by the frequenters of coffee-shops along the banks of the Thames. Small eels are also fried. But the many ways of dressing them which are common on the Continent are seldom practised in England.</p>
		<h2 id="756" class="formula">Pike</h2>
		<p>Plentiful and of excellent quality; only used in the preparation of forcemeat and quenelles; the directions for the latter will be given later. Albeit they are sometimes served crimped, or cooked whole in a <em>court-bouillon au bleu</em>, accompanied by <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#119a">parsley</a> or <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#68">caper sauce</a>, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>. Small pike are generally prepared “<a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>”, or fried.</p>
		<h2 id="757" class="formula">Carp</h2>
		<p>In still less demand than the pike, and only prized for its milt. It must, however, be admitted that in England, more than anywhere else, I believe, this fish is too often spoilt by the taint of mud.</p>
		<h2 id="758" class="formula">Dorado</h2>
		<p>Served boiled with any of the English fish sauces; but, in my opinion, it is best grilled, after the manner generally adopted in the South of France.</p>
		<h2 id="759" class="formula">Sturgeon</h2>
		<p>Very rare; it is braised, like veal.</p>
		<h2 id="760" class="formula">Féra</h2>
		<p>Comes from the Swiss or Savoy lakes, and is only served <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="761" class="formula">Gudgeon</h2>
		<p>Very abundant in all rivers, but never eaten.</p>
		<h2 id="762" class="formula">Frogs</h2>
		<p>The pet abomination of all classes of the population, with but few exceptions; nevertheless “<a href="11-hors-doeuvres.xhtml#351">Nymphes à l’Aurore</a>”, the recipe of which I gave among the hors-d’œuvres, are generally appreciated.</p>
		<h2 id="763" class="formula">Fresh Herrings</h2>
		<p>Abundant and of excellent quality; seldom used in first-class cookery, except, perhaps, for their milt. Bloaters and kippered herrings are, with reason, preferred; of these I shall speak later.</p>
		<h2 id="764" class="formula">Fresh Herrings</h2>
		<p>Chiefly used in preparing pies similar to those referred to in <a href="#755">№755</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="765" class="formula">Fresh-water Herrings</h2>
		<p>like the Féra, come from Switzerland or Savoy, and are very scarce on the English market Prepared especially <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="766" class="formula">Lote</h2>
		<p>Very scarce on the English market; only prized for its liver.</p>
		<h2 id="767" class="formula">Mostele</h2>
		<p>Only caught in the region of Monaco; cannot bear transport; especially served <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a> or a <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#174">l’Anglaise</a>.</p>
		<h2 id="768" class="formula">Mussels</h2>
		<p>Only used as garnish</p>
		<h2 id="769" class="formula">Nonat</h2>
		<p>Replaced in England by whitebait, which it greatly resembles.</p>
		<h2 id="770" class="formula">Perch</h2>
		<p>Very moderately appreciated; chiefly served fried, when small, and boiled with some fish sauce when large.</p>
		<h2 id="771" class="formula">Skate</h2>
		<p>Generally served boiled, with <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#68">caper sauce</a> occasionally with brown butter. The smaller specimens are better fried. Often offered for sale, crimped.</p>
		<h2 id="772" class="formula">Sardines</h2>
		<p>Generally of inferior quality; used in the preparation of sprats.</p>
		<h2 id="773" class="formula">Sterlet</h2>
		<p>Almost unknown in England.</p>
		<h2 id="774" class="formula">Turtle</h2>
		<p>With the exception of those firms which make this their speciality, is almost exclusively used in preparing Turtle Soup. The flippers are sometimes served braised au Madère.</p>
		<p>I do not think it at all necessary to lay any further stress upon the series of preparations bearing the names of <em>Croquettes</em>, <em>Cromesquis</em>, <em>Cotelettes</em> (cotelettes here only mean those prepared from cooked fish, and which are really but a form of croquettes), <em>Coquilles</em>, <em>Bouchées</em>, <em>Palets</em>, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, which may be made from any kind of cooked fish. These preparations are so well known that it would be almost superfluous to repeat their recipes.</p>
		<h2 id="775" class="formula">Divers Ways of Cooking Fish</h2>
		<p>The divers ways of cooking fish are all derived from one or another of the following methods:—</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Boiling in salted water, which may be applied equally well to large pieces and slices of fish.</li>
			<li>Frying, particularly suited to small specimens and thin slices of larger ones.</li>
			<li>Cooking in butter, otherwise “<a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>”, best suited to the same pieces as №2.</li>
			<li>Poaching, with short moistening, especially suited to fillets or small specimens.</li>
			<li>Braising, used particularly for large pieces.</li>
			<li>Grilling, for small specimens and collops.</li>
			<li>Cooking au Gratin, same as grilling.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="776" class="formula">The Boiling of Fish in Salted Water</h2>
		<p>The procedure changes according as to whether the fish is to be cooked whole or in slices. If whole, after having properly cleaned, washed, and trimmed it, lay it on the drainer of the utensil best suited to its shape; <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, a fish-kettle. Cover it with water, salt it in the proportion of one-quarter&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of salt per quart of water, cover the utensil, and bring the liquid to the boil. As soon as this is done skim and move the kettle to the side of the fire, where the cooking of the fish may be completed without boiling.</p>
		<p>If the fish is cut into slices, plunge these, which should never be cut too thin, into boiling salted water, and move the fish-kettle containing them to the side of the fire; complete their cooking slowly without allowing the water to boil.</p>
		<p>The object of this process is to concentrate, inside the fish, all the juices contained in its flesh, whereof a large portion escapes when the cut fish is plunged in cold water gradually brought to the boil. If this method is not applied to large fish, cooked whole, the reason is that the sudden immersion of these in boiling water would cause such a shrinking of their flesh that they would burst and thereby be spoiled.</p>
		<p>In the case of certain kinds of fish, such as Turbot and Brill, milk is added to the water in the proportion of one-eighth of the latter, the object being to increase the whiteness of the fish.</p>
		<p>For the various kinds of Salmon and Trout, the <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-bouillon</em> (formula&#160;№163)</a> is used in the place of salted water, but the general working process remains the same.</p>
		<p>The boiled fish is dished on a napkin and drainer; it is garnished with fresh parsley; and the sauce announced on the menu, together with some plain-boiled and floury potatoes, is sent to the table separately.</p>
		<h2 id="777" class="formula">The Frying of Fish</h2>
		<p>In Part I. of this work I explained the general theory of <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#26a">frying (Chapter X., formula&#160;№26a)</a>; I shall now, therefore, only concern myself with the details of the operation in its relation to fish.</p>
		<p>As a rule, frying should never be resorted to for very large fish or very thick slices of the latter, for, owing to the very high temperature that the operation enjoins, the outside of the fish would be dried up before the inside had even become affected.</p>
		<p>If the fish to be fried is somewhat thick, it is best to cut several gashes in it, lengthwise and across, these being deeper and closer together the thicker the fish may be. The object of this measure is to facilitate the cooking, but the measure itself is quite unnecessary when dealing with small fish. In the case of flat-fish, partly detach the two underlying fillets on either side of the back-bone instead of gashing them.</p>
		<p>All fish intended for frying (except <em>Blanchailles</em> and Whitebait) should first be steeped in salted milk, then rolled in flour before being plunged into the hot fat. If they be “panés à l’anglaise”, however, as they generally are in England, the milk may be dispensed with, in which case, after they have been lightly coated with flour, they are completely dipped in an <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#174">anglaise (formula&#160;№174)</a> and afterwards rolled in white breadcrumbs. They should then be patted with the blade of a knife so as to ensure the cohesion of the whole coating, and, finally, the latter should be criss-crossed with the back of a knife with the view of improving the appearance when fried.</p>
		<p>Fried fish are served either on a napkin, on a drainer, or on special dish-papers. They are garnished with fried parsley and properly trimmed half-lemons.</p>
		<h2 id="778" class="formula">The Cooking of Fish à la Meunière</h2>
		<p>This excellent mode of procedure is only suited to small fish or the slices of larger ones. Nevertheless, it may be resorted to for chicken-turbots, provided their weight do not exceed four&#160;<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr></p>
		<p>The operation consists in cooking the fish (or slices or fillets of fish) in the frying-pan with very hot butter, after having seasoned them and sprinkled them with flour. If the fish are very small, ordinary butter is used; if, on the other hand, they are large, the procedure demands clarified butter. When the fish is sufficiently coloured on one side, it is turned over for the completion of the operation. This done, it is transferred, by means of a spatula, to a hot dish, whereon, after having been salted, it is sent to the table.</p>
		<p>It may be served as it is with a garnish of trimmed half-lemons.</p>
		<p>Fish prepared in this way are termed “dorés” (<em>gilded</em>), “Soles dorés”, “Turbotins dorés”, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in order to distinguish them from those prepared à la Meunière.</p>
		<p>If the fish is announced “à la Meunière”, a few drops of lemon should be sprinkled upon it; it should be seasoned with salt and pepper, and garnished with concassed, scalded parsley. At the last moment a piece of butter, in proportion to the size of the fish, is put in the frying-pan, and is heated until it begins to brown slightly. This is poured over the fish immediately, and the latter is sent to the table at once while still covered by the froth resulting from the contact of the butter with the parsley.</p>
		<h2 id="779" class="formula">The Poaching of Fish</h2>
		<p>This method is best suited to sole, chicken-turbots, and brill, as well as to the fillets of various fish.</p>
		<p>Having laid the fish to be poached in a baking-tray or a sauté-pan, either of which should have been previously buttered, season it moderately with salt and moisten with a little very white fish or mushroom <em>fumet</em>; very often the two latter are mixed. Cover the utensil, push it into a moderate oven, and baste from time to time, especially when a large fish is cooking. When the fish is done, drain it carefully, place it on a dish, and, as a rule, reduce the poaching-liquor and add it to the sauce. Poached fish are always served sauced; <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, covered with the sauce which properly forms their accompaniment. More often than not they are garnished after the manner which will be described later.</p>
		<div class="inline-list">
			<p>I most emphatically urge:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>the use of very little fish fumet for the poaching, but this fumet should be perfect and should, above all, not be cooked for longer than the required time;</li>
				<li>that the fish be not covered with buttered paper as is often done, for nowadays a suitable paper is very rarely found. All papers found on the market are, owing to the chemical products used in their manufacture, liable to impart a more or less pungent smell to the objects they enclose, which in either degree would prove seriously prejudicial to the preparation.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<p>These remarks not only apply to fish, but to all those objects with which paper was formerly used at some stage in their cooking process.</p>
		<h2 id="780" class="formula">The Braising of Fish</h2>
		<p>This method is generally applied to whole or sliced salmon, to trout, and to chicken-turbot. Sometimes the fish treated in this way is larded on one side with strips of bacon-fat, truffles, gherkins, or carrots. The mode of procedure is exactly the same as that described under the <a href="10-leading-culinary-operations.xhtml#248">“Braising of White Meats” (formula&#160;№248)</a>. Moisten these braisings in the proportion of one-half with white wine or red wine (according as to how the fish is to be served), and for the other half use a light fish fumet. Place the fish on the drainer of a fish-kettle just large enough to hold the former, and moisten in such wise that the cooking-liquor at the beginning of the operation does not cover more than three-quarters of the depth of the fish. Unless it be for a Lenten dish, the fish may be covered with slices of bacon while cooking. In any case, baste it often. Take care not to close the lid down too tightly, in order that the liquor may be reduced simultaneously with the cooking of the fish.</p>
		<p>When the operation is almost completed, take the lid off the fish-kettle with the view of glazing the fish; then take the former off the fire. Now withdraw the drainer with the fish upon it, and lay it athwart the top of the fish-kettle, and let it drain; tilt the fish on to a dish, and cover the latter pending its despatch to the table. Strain the stock remaining in the fish-kettle through a strainer; let it stand for ten minutes, remove all the grease that has formed on its surface, and use it to complete the sauce as I directed above.</p>
		<p>Braised fish are generally accompanied by a garnish, the constituents of which I shall give in the particular recipes relating to braising.</p>
		<h2 id="781" class="formula">The Grilling of Fish</h2>
		<p>This method is best suited to small fish, to medium-sized chicken-turbots, and to large-sectioned fish.</p>
		<p>Unless they are very small, it is best to gash both sides of fish intended for grilling; the reasons given above for this measure likewise apply here.</p>
		<p>All white and naturally dry fish should be rolled in flour and besprinkled with butter or very good oil before being placed on the grill to be exposed to the heat of the fire. The flour forms a crust around the fish, which keeps it from drying and gives it that golden colour quite peculiar to objects thus treated.</p>
		<p>Salmon, trout, red mullet, mackerel, and herrings, the flesh whereof is fatty, need not be floured, but only besprinkled with melted butter.</p>
		<p>Owing to the somewhat fragile texture of most fish, a special double gridiron is used, by means of which they may be turned without fear of damage. This gridiron is placed upon the ordinary grill. I have already given in Part I. of this work the <a href="10-leading-culinary-operations.xhtml#257">radical principles of grilling (formula&#160;№257)</a>; to this, therefore, the reader is begged to refer.</p>
		<p>Grilled fish are served on a very hot dish, without paper or a napkin; they are garnished with fresh parsley and grooved slices of lemon.</p>
		<p><a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#150">Butter à la Maître d’Hôtel</a>, <a href="11-hors-doeuvres.xhtml#281">anchovy butter</a>, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#36">devilled sauce</a>, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#53">Escoffier Roberts’ sauce</a>, and <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#140">butter à la Ravigote</a> constitute the best adjuncts to grilled fish.</p>
		<h2 id="782" class="formula">The Cooking of Fish au Gratin</h2>
		<p>I described all the details of this method under <a href="10-leading-culinary-operations.xhtml#269">Complete Gratin (formula&#160;№269)</a>, to which I must ask the reader to refer. This process is best suited to small fish, such as sole, whiting, red mullet, chicken-turbot, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>.</p>
		<h2 id="783" class="formula">The Crimping of Fish</h2>
		<p>Crimped fish is quite an English speciality. This method of preparation is applied more particularly to salmon, fresh cod, haddock, and skate. The first three of these fish may be prepared whole or in slices, while skate is always cut into more or less large pieces after it has been skinned on both sides.</p>
		<p>In order to crimp a whole fish, it should be taken as it leaves the water. Lay it on something flat, and make deep lateral gashes on both its sides from head to tail. Allow a space of about one and one-half inches to two inches between each gash. This done, put the fish to soak in very cold water for an hour or so. When the fish is to be cooked sliced, divide it up as soon as it is caught, and put the slices to soak in very cold water, as in the case of the whole fish.</p>
		<p>But does this barbarous method, which stiffens and contracts the flesh of the fish, affect its quality so materially as connoisseurs would have us believe?</p>
		<p>It is very difficult to say, and opinions on the matter are divided. This, however, is certain, that fish prepared in the way above described is greatly relished by many.</p>
		<p>Whether whole or sliced, crimped fish is always boiled in salted water. Its cooking presents a real difficulty, in that it must be stopped at the precise moment when it is completed, any delay in this respect proving prejudicial to the quality of the dish.</p>
		<p>Crimped fish is served like the boiled kind, and all the sauces suited to the latter likewise obtain with the former. Besides the selected sauce, send a sauceboat to the table containing some of the cooking-liquor of the fish.</p>
		<h2>Salmon (Saumon)</h2>
		<p>Salmon caught on the Rhine, or Dutch salmon, is generally considered the most delicate that may be had, though, in my opinion, ihat obtained from certain English rivers, such, for instance, as the Severn, is by no means inferior to the foregoing. Here in England this excellent fish is held in the high esteem it deserves, and the quantity consumed in this country is considerable. It is served as plainly as possible, either boiled, cold or hot, grilled, or <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>; but whatever be the method of preparation, it is always accompanied by cucumber salad.</p>
		<p>The slices of salmon, however, thick or thin, large or small, take the name of “Darnes”.</p>
		<h2 id="784" class="formula">Boiled Salmon</h2>
		<p>Boiled salmon, whether whole or sliced, should be cooked in <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-bouillon</em></a> in accordance with directions given at the <a href="#776">beginning of the chapter (formula&#160;№776)</a>. All fish sauces are suited to it, but more especially the following, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>:—<a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#30">Hollandaise sauce</a>, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#92">Mousseline sauce</a>, Melted Butter, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#79">Shrimp Sauce</a>, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#95">Nantua sauce</a>, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#69">Cardinal Sauce</a>, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<p><em>Crimped</em> salmon admits of precisely the same sauces.</p>
		<h2 id="785" class="formula">Broiled Salmon</h2>
		<p>Cut the salmon to be grilled in slices from one inch to one and one-half inches thick. Season with table-salt, sprinkle with melted butter or oil, and grill it for the first part on a rather brisk fire, taking care to moderate the latter towards the close of the operation. Allow about twenty-five&#160;minutes for the grilling of a slice of salmon one and one-half inches thick. <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#150">Butter à la Maître d’Hôtel</a>, <a href="11-hors-doeuvres.xhtml#281">anchovy butter</a>, and <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#37">devilled sauce Escoffier</a> are the most usual adjuncts to grilled salmon.</p>
		<h2 id="786" class="formula">Salmon à la Meunière</h2>
		<p>Having cut the salmon into moderately thick slices, season these, dredge them slightly, and cook them in the frying-pan with very hot clarified butter.</p>
		<p>It is important that the salmon be set and that the cooking be rapid.</p>
		<p>Serve it in either of the two ways indicated <a href="#778">above (formula&#160;№778)</a>.</p>
		<h2>Various Ways of Preparing Salmon</h2>
		<p>In addition to the three methods of serving salmon described above, and those cold preparations with which I shall deal later, the fish in question lends itself to a whole host of dressings which are of the greatest utility in the varying of menus. The principles of these dressings I shall now give.</p>
		<h3 id="787" class="formula">Cadgeree of Salmon</h3>
		<p>Prepare one&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of cooked salmon, cleared of bones and skin, and cut into small pieces; four hard-boiled eggs cut into dice; one&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of well-cooked pilaff rice; and three-quarters pint of <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel</a> flavoured with curry.</p>
		<p>Dish in a hot timbale, alternating the various products, and finish with a coating of sauce.</p>
		<h3 id="788" class="formula">Cotelettes de Saumon</h3>
		<p>Prepare some <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat for salmon, the quantity whereof will be in accordance with the number of cutlets to be made, and rub it through a coarse sieve. Line the bottom and sides of some buttered tin moulds, shaped like cutlets, with a coating one-half&#160;inch thick of the prepared forcemeat.</p>
		<p>Fill the moulds to within one-third inch of their brims with a cold <em>salpicon</em> of mushrooms and truffles, thickened by means of reduced Allemande sauce, and cover this with the stuffing.</p>
		<p>Set the cutlets to poach, turn out the moulds; treat the cutlets <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#174"><em>à l’anglaise</em></a>, and cook them with clarified butter.</p>
		<p>Arrange in a circle round a dish, put a frill on a piece of fried bread counterfeiting the bone of the cutlet, garnish with fried parsley, and send to the table, separately, a “Dieppoise” sauce. Shrimp sauce, or a purée of fresh vegetables, such as peas, carrots, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In the latter case, serve at the same time a sauce in keeping with the garnish.</p>
		<h3 id="789" class="formula">Coulibiac de Saumon</h3>
		<p><em>Preparation</em>.—Have ready two&#160;<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of ordinary <a href="#">brioche paste without sugar (formula&#160;№2368)</a>. Stiffen in butter one and one-half&#160; <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of small salmon collops, and prepare one-sixth&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of mushrooms and one&#160;chopped&#160;onion (both of which should be fried in butter), one-half&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of <a href="#">semolina kache (formula&#160;№2292)</a> or the same weight of rice cooked in consommé; two&#160;hard-boiled eggs, chopped; and one&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of <em>vesiga</em>, roughly chopped and cooked in consommé.</p>
		<p>For this weight of cooked <em>vesiga</em> about two and one-half&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of dried <em>vesiga</em> will be needed, which should be soaked for at least four&#160;hours in cold water, and then cooked for three and one-half hours in <a href="01-fonds-de-cuisine.xhtml#1">white consommé</a>. It may also be cooked in water.</p>
		<p>Roll the brioche paste into rectangles twelve&#160;inches long by eight&#160;inches wide, and spread thereon in successive layers the kache or the rice, the collops of salmon, the chopped <em>vesiga</em>, the eggs, the mushrooms, and the onion, and finish with a layer of kache or rice. Moisten the edges of the paste and draw the longest ends of it towards each other over the enumerated layers of garnish, and join them so as to properly enclose the latter.</p>
		<p>Now fold the two remaining ends over to the centre in a similar way. Place the coulibiac thus formed on a baking-tray, and take care to turn it over in order that the joining parts of the paste lie underneath.</p>
		<p>Set the paste to rise for twenty-five&#160;minutes, sprinkle some melted butter over the coulibiac, sprinkle with some very fine raspings, make a slit in the top for the escape of vapour, and bake in a moderate oven for forty-five or fifty&#160;minutes. Fill the coulibiac with freshly-melted butter when withdrawing it from the oven.</p>
		<h2>Darnes de Saumon</h2>
		<p>The few recipes dealing with “Darnes de Saumon”, which I give below, may also be adapted to whole salmon after the size of the fish has been taken into account in measuring the time allowed for cooking.</p>
		<h3 id="790" class="formula">Darne de Saumon à Chambord</h3>
		<p>As already explained, the term “darne” stands for a piece of salmon cut from the middle of that fish, and the size of a darne is in proportion to the number of people it is intended for.</p>
		<p>Proceed after the manner directed under <a href="#780">“The Braising of Fish” (formula&#160;№780)</a>; moisten in the proportion of two-thirds&#160;with excellent red wine and one-third&#160;with fish&#160;stock, calculating the quantity in such wise that it may cover no more than two-thirds of the depth of the darne. Bring to the boil, then set to braise gently, and glaze the darne at the last moment.</p>
		<p><em>Garnish and Sauce</em>.—Garnish with quenelles of truffled <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat for fish, moulded by means of a spoon: two large ornamented quenelles; truffles fashioned like olives; pieces of milt dipped in <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#108">Villeroy sauce</a>, treated <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#174"><em>à l’anglaise</em></a> and fried when about to dish up; small gudgeon or smelts treated similarly to the milt, and trussed crayfish cooked in <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-bouillon</em></a>.</p>
		<p>The sauce is a <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#38">Genevoise</a>, made from the reduced cooking-liquor of the darne.</p>
		<p><em>Dishing Up</em>.—Surround the darne by the garnishes enumerated, arranging them tastefully, and pierce it with two&#160;<em>hatelets</em>, each garnished with a small truffle, an ornamented quenelle, and a crayfish.</p>
		<p>Send the sauce to the table separately.</p>
		<h3 id="791" class="formula">Darne de Saumon à Daumont</h3>
		<p>Poach the dame in a <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-bouillon</em></a> prepared beforehand.</p>
		<h4>Dishing Up and Garnish</h4>
		<p>Surround the darne by medium-sized mushrooms stewed in butter and garnished with small crayfish tails cohered by means of a few tablespoonfuls of Nantua sauce; small round quenelles of <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat for fish, decorated with truffles, and some slices of milt treated <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#174">à l’anglaise</a>, and fried when about to dish up.</p>
		<p>Serve the Nantua sauce separately.</p>
		<h3 id="792" class="formula">Darne de Saumon à Lucullus</h3>
		<p>Skin one side of the darne, lard it with truffles, and braise it in champagne.</p>
		<h4>The Garnish Round the Darne</h4>
		<p>Very small garnished patties of crayfish tails; small <em>cassolettes</em> of milt; small <em>mousselines</em> of oysters, poached in <em>dariole-moulds</em>.</p>
		<h4>Sauce</h4>
		<p>The braising-liquor of the darne finished by means of ordinary and crayfish butter in equal quantities. Send it to the table separately.</p>
		<h3 id="793" class="formula">Darne de Saumon à Nesselrode</h3>
		<p>Remove the spine and all other internal bones. Stuff the darne with raw lobster <em>mousse</em> stiffened by means of a little pike forcemeat.</p>
		<p>Line a well-buttered, round and even raised-pie mould with a thin layer of hot-water, raised-pie paste (this is made from one&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of flour, four&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of lard, one egg, and a little lukewarm water), which should be prepared in advance and made somewhat stiff. Now garnish the inside of the pie with thin slices of bacon and place the darne upright in it. (To simplify the operation the darne may be stuffed at this stage.) Cover the pie with a layer of the same paste, pinch its edges with those of the original lining, make a slit in the top for the steam to escape, and cook in a good oven.</p>
		<p>When the pie is almost baked, prod it repeatedly with a larding-needle; whenthelatteriswithdrawnclearofallstuffing the pie should be taken from the oven. This done, turn it upside down in order to drain away the melted bacon and other liquids inside it, but do not let it drop from the mould. Then tilt it on to a dish and take off the mould. Do not break the crust except at the dining-table.</p>
		<h4>Sauce</h4>
		<p>Serve an <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#58">American sauce</a> with the pie, the former being prepared from the remains of the lobsters used in making the mousse, finished with cream, and garnished with very fine oysters (cleared of their beards), poached when about to dish up.</p>

		<h4>Garnish</h4>
		<p>Potato balls raised with the spoon-cutter or turned to the shape of olives, and cooked in salted water, poached slices of milt, and trussed crayfish cooked in <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-boullion</em></a>.</p>
		<p>Send a <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#63">Valois sauce</a> separately.</p>
		<h3 id="797" class="formula">Mousseline de Saumon</h3>
		<p>In Part I. I dealt with the preparation of <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#195">mousseline forcemeat (formula&#160;№195)</a>, and also the method of <a href="07-elementary-preparations.xhtml#205">poaching spoon-moulded quenelles (formula&#160;№205)</a>. Now <em>mousselines</em> are only large quenelles which derive their name from the very light forcemeat of which they are composed. These <em>mousseline</em> quenelles are always moulded with the ordinary tablespoon, they are garnished on top with a fine, raw slice of the fish under treatment, and poached after the manner already described.</p>
		<h3 id="798" class="formula">Mousseline Alexandra</h3>
		<p>Having made the salmon <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat, mould tha quenelles and place them, one by one, in a buttered sauté-pan. Place a small, round and very thin slice of salmon on each, and poach them in a very moderate oven with lid on the utensil containing them.</p>
		<p>Drain on a piece of linen, arrange them in a circle on a dish, place a slice of truffle upon each slice of salmon, coat with Mornay sauce, and glaze.</p>
		<p>Garnish the centre of the dish with very small peas or asparagus-heads cohered with butter just before dishing up.</p>
		<h3 id="799" class="formula">Mousseline de Saumon à la Tosca</h3>
		<p>Combine one and one-half&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of crayfish cream-cullis with each pound of the salmon <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat. Mould and poach as above, drain, and arrange in a circle on a dish.</p>
		<p>Garnish each <em>mousseline</em> with a thin slice of milt cooked in lightly-browned butter, four crayfish tails cut lengthwise into two, and a slice of truffle at each end. Coat with a light <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#91">Mornay sauce</a>, finished with crayfish butter, and glaze quickly.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—In addition to these two recipes, all the garnishes suitable for fillets of sole may be applied to <em>mousselines</em>. Garnishes of early-season vegetable purées also suit them admirably, and therein lies an almost inexhaustible source of variety.</p>
		<h3 id="800" class="formula">Cold Salmon</h3>
		<p>When salmon is to be served cold it should, as far as possible, be cooked, either whole or in large pieces, in the <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml#163"><em>court-bouillon</em> given under formula&#160;№163</a> and cooled in the latter. Pieces cooked separately may seem better or may be more easily made to look sightly, but their meat is drier than that of the salmon cooked whole. And what is lost in appearance with the very large pieces is more than compensated for by their extra quality.</p>
		<p>In dishing cold salmon the skin may be removed and the fillets bared, so that the fish may be more easily decorated, but the real gourmet will always prefer the salmon served in its natural silver vestment.</p>
		<p>In decorating cold salmon use pieces of cucumber, anchovy fillets, capers, slices of tomato, curled-leaf parsley, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<p>I am not partial to the decorating of salmon with softened butter, coloured or not, laid on by means of the piping-bag. Apart from the fact that this method of decoration is rarely artistic, the butter used combines badly with the cold sauces and the meat of the salmon on the diner’s plate. Very green tarragon leaves, chervil, lobster coral, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, afford a more natural and more delicate means of ornamentation. The only butter fit to be served with cold salmon is <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#153">Montpellier butter (formula&#160;№153)</a>, though this, in fact, is but a cold sauce often resorted to for the coating of the cold fish in question.</p>
		<p>Among the garnishes which suit cold salmon, I might mention small peeled, and emptied tomatoes garnished with some kind of salad; hard-boiled eggs, either wholly stuffed, or stuffed in halves or in quarters, <em>barquettes</em>, tartlets and <em>cassolettes</em> made from cucumber or beetroot, parboiled until almost completely cooked and garnished with a purée of tunny, of sardines, of anchovies, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; small aspics of shrimps or of crayfishes’ tails; small slices of lobster, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<p>Almost all the cold sauces may accompany cold salmon.</p>
		<h3 id="801" class="formula">Saumon Froid, ou Darne de Saumon Froid à la Royale</h3>
		<p>Having drained and dried the salmon or the darne, remove the skin from one of its sides, and coat the bared fillets with a layer of a preparation of <em>mousse</em> de saumon, letting it lie rather more thickly over the middle than the sides. Coat the layer of <em>mousse</em> with mayonnaise sauce thickened by means of fish jelly, and leave to set.</p>
		<p>Now let some clear fish jelly set on the bottom of the dish to besenttothetable; placethesalmonorthedarneonthisjelly, and surround the piece with a border consisting of Montpellier butter, using for the purpose a piping-bag fitted with a grooved pipe.</p>
		<p>Decorate the centre of the piece by means of a fine fleur-de-lys made from truffes, and encircle it with two royale crowns made from anchovy fillets.</p>
		<h3 id="802" class="formula">Saumon Froid ou Darne de Saumon à la Parisienne</h3>
		<p>Remove the skin in suchwise as to leave the bared portion in the shape of a regular rectangle, equidistant from the tail and the head; or, in the case of a darne, occupying two-thirds of its surface.</p>
		<p>Cover the bared portion with mayonnaise sauce thickened with fish jelly and leave it to set.</p>
		<p>Now stand the piece on a small cushion of rice or semolina, shaping the latter like the piece itself; trim the sauced rectangle with a border of <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#153">Montpellier butter</a>, laid on by means of a piping-bag fitted with a small grooved pipe. Garnish the centre of the rectangle with pieces of lobster coral, the chopped, hard-boiled white and yolk of an egg, chervil leaves, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<p>Encircle the piece with a border of small artichoke-bottoms, garnished, in the form of a dome, with a small <em>macédoine</em> of vegetables cohered with cleared mayonnaise.</p>
		<p>Send a <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#126">mayonnaise sauce</a> to the table separately.</p>
		<h3 id="803" class="formula">Saumon Froid ou Darne de Saumon Froid à la Riga</h3>
		<p>Prepare a salmon or a darne as in the preceding recipe, and dish it on a cushion in order that it may be slightly raised.</p>
		<p>Surround it with grooved sections of cucumber hollowed to represent small timbales, well parboiled, <em>marinaded</em> with a few drops of oil and lemon-juice and filled with a vegetable salad thickened with mayonnaise; indented, halved eggs filled with caviare; and tartlets of vegetable salad cohered with mayonnaise, and garnished, each with a crayfish-shell stuffed with crayfish mousse; alternate these various garnishes, and encircle with a border of jelly dice.</p>
		<h3 id="804" class="formula">Saumon Froid ou Darne de Saumon Froid en Belle-Vue</h3>
		<p>Skin the salmon or the darne, set the piece upright upon the belly side, and decorate the fillets with pieces of truffles, poached white of egg, chervil leaves, and tarragon, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<p>Coat the garnish with a little melted fish aspic so as to fix it.</p>
		<p>This done, sprinkle the piece, again and again, with the same melted aspic jelly in order to cover it with a kind of transparent veil.</p>
		<p>Place the piece thus prepared in a crystal receptacle similarly shaped to the fish, and fill the former to the brim with very clear, melted jelly.</p>
		<p>When dishing up, incrust the receptable containing the fish in a block of clean ice which, in its turn, is laid on the dish to be sent to the table. Another way is to place the crystal utensil direct upon the dish and to surround the former with broken ice.</p>
		<h3 id="805" class="formula">Saumon Froid ou Darne de Saumon Froid au Chambertin</h3>
		<p>Poach the salmon or the darne in a <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml"><em>court-bouillon</em></a> consisting of very clear fish <em>fumet</em> and Chambertin wine, in equal quantities, and leave to cool. Prepare an aspic jelly from the <em>court-bouillon</em>.</p>
		<p>Skin and decorate the salmon or the darne and glaze it with white aspic jelly, exactly as directed above, in the case of the Belle-vue.</p>
		<p>Dish in the same way, in a crystal receptacle, and fill the latter with the prepared aspic jelly. Serve on a block of ice, or with broken ice around the utensil.</p>
		<h3 id="806" class="formula">Saumon Froid ou Darne de Saumon Froid à la Norvegienne</h3>
		<p>Skin and decorate the salmon or the darne, and glaze it with white aspic jelly precisely as in <a href="#804">formula&#160;№804</a>.</p>
		<p>Let a coating of very clear jelly set on the bottom of the dish to be sent to the table. Upon this aspic jelly lay a cushion the same shape as the fish, of semolina, or of carved rice.</p>
		<p>Set the piece (salmon or darne), decorated and glazed, upon this cushion, and lay thereon a row of fine prawns, cleared of their abdominal shell.</p>
		<p>Surround with a garnish of small cucumber timbales, well parboiled, <em>marinaded</em>, and garnished dome-fashion, with a purée of smoked salmon; halved, hard-boiled eggs, glazed with aspic; very small tomatoes, or halved medium-sized ones, peeled, pressed in the corner of a towel to return them to their original shape, stuck with a bit of parsley-stalk, and decorated with leaves of green butter moulded by means of the piping-bag; and small <em>barquettes</em> of cooked and <em>marinaded</em> beetroot, garnished with shrimps’ tails cohered with <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#126">mayonnaise</a>.</p>
		<p>Send a Russe sauce separately.</p>
		<h3 id="807" class="formula">Cotelettes Froid de Saumon</h3>
		<p>Liberally butter some tin cutlet-shaped moulds. Line their bottoms and sides with a very red slice of salmon, as thin as a piece of cardboard. This slice should be long enough to project outside the brim of the mould to the extent of one-half&#160;inch.</p>
		<p>Garnish the insides of the moulds with well-seasoned salmon meat, and draw the projecting lengths of salmon across this meat so as to enclose the latter and finish off the cutlets.</p>
		<p>Arrange the moulds on a baking-tray; poach the cutlets, dry, in a moderate oven; turn them out of their moulds on to another tray as soon as they are poached, and let them cool. Then coat them with a half-melted aspic, and decorate them according to fancy, either with very green peas or a leaf of chervil with a bit of lobster coral in its centre—in a word, something simple and neat.</p>
		<p>These cutlets, which are generally served at ball-suppers, may be dished on a tazza, on a cushion of rice, semolina, cornflour, or stearine, and laid almost vertically against a pyramid of vegetable salad cohered by means of mayonnaise with aspic. In this case the dish is finished ofif with a <em>hatelet</em> stuck into the middle of the pyramid.</p>
		<p>The cutlets may also be arranged in a circle on a flat, shallow, silver or crystal dish, and covered with a delicate cold melted jelly.</p>
		<p>Whatever be the selected method of dishing, always send to the table with the cutlet a sauceboat of cold sauce.</p>
		<h3 id="808" class="formula">Médaillons de Saumon</h3>
		<p>These médallions have the same purpose as the cutlets already described, and are prepared thus:—</p>
		<p>Cut some small slices, one-third&#160;inch thick, from a fillet of salmon.</p>
		<p>Arrange them on a buttered tray; poach them, dry, in a moderate oven, and cool them under a light weight.</p>
		<p>Now trim them neatly, with an even cutter, oval or round, in accordance with the shape they are intended to have.</p>
		<p>Coat them, according to their purpose, either with <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#126">mayonnaise sauce</a> or one of its derivatives, thickened with jelly, or a white, pink, or green chaud-froid sauce. Decorate it in any way that may be fancied, and glaze them with cold melted aspic jelly.</p>
		<p>Dish after the manner described under “<em>Cotelettes</em>” (see above).</p>
		<h3 id="809" class="formula">Mayonnaise de Saumon</h3>
		<p>Garnish the bottom of a salad-bowl with moderately seasoned, <em>ciseled</em> lettuce. Cover with cold, cooked and flaked salmon, thoroughly cleared of all skin and bones.</p>
		<p>Coat with <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#126">mayonnaise sauce</a>, and decorate with anchovy fillets, capers, stoned olives, small slices or roundels or quarters of hard-boiled eggs, small hearts of lettuce, a border of little roundels of radish, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<h3 id="810" class="formula">Salade de Saumon</h3>
		<p>This preparation comprises the same ingredients as the above, with the exception of the mayonnaise sauce. The decorating garnish is placed directly upon the salmon, and the whole is seasoned in precisely the same way as an ordinary salad.</p>
		<h2>Trout</h2>
		<p>From the culinary standpoint, trout are divided into two quite distinct classes, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, large trout, whereof the typical specimen is Salmon-trout, and small or fresh-water trout.</p>
		<h3 id="811" class="formula">Truite Saumonée <span class="subtitle">(Salmon Trout)</span></h3>
		<p>In its many preparations, salmon-trout may be replaced by salmon, and all the recipes relating to the former may be adapted to the latter.</p>
		<p>In any case, however, as its size is less than that of salmon, it is very rarely cut into darnes, being more generally served whole.</p>
		<p>The few recipes that follow are proper to salmon-trout.</p>
		<h3 id="812" class="formula">Truite à la Cambacérès</h3>
		<p>Select a male trout in preference; clean it, and remove its gills without opening it in the region of the belly.</p>
		<p>Skin it on one side, starting at a distance of one inch from the head and finishing within two and one-half inches of the root of the tail.</p>
		<p>Lard the bared portions with truffles and the red part only of carrots cut into rods.</p>
		<p>This done, spread out a napkin, lay the trout thereon, belly under, and, with a sharp knife, separate the two fillets from the bones, beginning in the region of the head and proceeding straight down to where the body converges towards the tail.</p>
		<p>The spine being thus liberated, sever it at both ends; <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, from the tail and the head, and withdraw it, together with all the adhering ventral bones. The intestines are then removed, the inside of the fish is well cleaned, the fillets are seasoned on their insides, and the trout is stuffed with a <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat of raw crayfish. The two fillets are drawn together, and the trout, thus reconstructed, is covered with thin slices of bacon and laid on the drainer of the fish-kettle and braised in Sauterne wine.</p>
		<p>When the fish is done, remove the slices of bacon, glaze it, and dish it up. Surround it with alternate heaps of morels tossed in butter and milt <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#151a">à la Meunière</a>.</p>
		<p>Send to the table, separately, a fine <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel sauce</a>, combined with the braising-liquor of the trout, strained and reduced, and finished with crayfish butter.</p>
		<h3 id="813" class="formula">Truite Saumonées Froides</h3>
		<p>We are now concerned with a whole series of unpublished “Trout” preparations, which are at once of superfine delicacy and agreeable aspect, and which admit of clean and easy dishing.</p>
		<p>Cook a trout weighing from two to three&#160;<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> in <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml">court-bouillon</a>, and let it cool in the latter. Then drain it; sever the head and tail from the body, and put them aside. Completely skin the whole fish, and carefully separate the two fillets from the bones.</p>
		<p>Deck each fillet with tarragon and chervil leaves, lobster coral, poached white of eggs, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, and set them, back to back, upon a <em>mousse</em> of tomatoes lying in a special, long white or coloured porcelain dish about one and one-half to two&#160;inches deep.</p>
		<p>Replace the head and tail, and cover the whole with a coating of half-melted, succulent fish aspic, somewhat clear. Let the aspic set, and incrust the dish containing the trout in a block of ice, or surround it with the latter broken.</p>
		<h3 id="814" class="formula">Préparation De La Mousse De Tomates</h3>
		<p>This <em>mousse</em>, like those which I shall give later, is really a <em>bavarois</em> without sugar. Its recipe is exactly the same as that of the “<em>bavarois</em> of fruit”, except with regard to the question of sugar.</p>
		<p>Cook one-half&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of tomato pulp (cleared of skin and seeds, and roughly chopped) in one&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter. When the pulp has thoroughly mingled with the butter, add thereto two&#160;tablespoonfuls of velouté thickened by means of eight leaves of gelatine per quart of the sauce.</p>
		<p>Rub through tammy, and add to the preparation, when almost cold, half of its volume of barely-whipped cream. Taste the mousse; season with a few drops of lemon juice, and if it still seems flat, add the necessary salt and a very little cayenne.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—It will be seen that I prescribe cream only half-whipped. This precaution, however, does not apply to “Mousse de Tomates” alone, but to all <em>mousses</em>. Well-whipped cream imparts a dry and woolly taste to them, whereas, when it is only half-whipped, it renders them unctuous and fresh to the palate.</p>
		<p>From the point of view of delicacy, the respective results of the two methods do not bear comparison.</p>
		<h3 id="815" class="formula">Other Preparations of Trout <span class="subtitle">after the same recipe</span></h3>
		<p>By proceeding exactly as directed in the foregoing recipe, and by substituting one of the following <em>mousses</em> for the “Mousse de Tomates”, it will be found that considerable variety may be introduced into menus:—</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Crayfish Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with crayfish tails and tarragon leaves.</li>
			<li><strong>Lobster Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with slices of lobster, coral, and chervil.</li>
			<li><strong>Shrimp Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with crayfish tails and capers.</li>
			<li><strong>Capsicum Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with strips of grilled capsicum.</li>
			<li><strong>Physalia Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with chervil, tarragon, and bunches of physalia around the fillets.</li>
			<li><strong>Green Pimentos Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with strips of green pimentos.</li>
			<li><strong>Early-season Herb Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with chopped, hard-boiled eggs, and chopped parsley.</li>
			<li id="815-08"><strong>Volnay Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout, decked with anchovy fillets, capers, and olives.</li>
			<li><strong>Chambertin Mousse</strong> with fillets of trout decked like <a href="#815-08">№8</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—In the making of “Mousse au Volnay” and “au Chambertin” the base of the preparations is supplied by cleared velouté, to which is added the reduced cooking-liquor of the trout.</p>
		<p>All these recipes are equally suitable for sole or chicken-turbot.</p>
		<h3 id="815a" class="formula">Ondines aux Crevettes Roses</h3>
		<p>Prepare a very delicate trout <em>mousse</em>, mould it in egg-moulds, and garnish the centre with trimmed prawns’ tails. Let the <em>mousse</em> set; then speedily turn the undines out of their moulds, and lay them in a deep entrée-dish. Between each of them lay a few prawns, the tails of which should be shelled. Cover the whole, little by little, with some excellent, half-melted jelly here and there add a few sprigs of chervil, and then fill up the dish with jelly, so as to completely cover the <em>mousses</em>.</p>
		<h3 id="816" class="formula">Fresh-water Trout</h3>
		<p>The best are those procured in mountainous districts, where the clear water they inhabit is constantly refreshed by strong currents.</p>
		<p>The two leading methods of preparing them are called, respectively, “Au bleu” and “à la Meunière”. Having already described the latter, I shall now give my attention to “Truite au bleu”.</p>
		<p>This preparation is held in very high esteem in Switzerland and Germany, where fresh-water trout are not only plentiful, but of excellent quality.</p>
		<h3 id="817" class="formula">Truites au bleu</h3>
		<p>The essential condition for this dish consists in having live trout. Prepare a <a href="06-the-court-bouillons-and-the-marinades.xhtml#163"><em>court-bouillon</em> with plenty of vinegar (formula&#160;№163)</a>, and keep it boiling in a rather shallow basin.</p>
		<p>About ten&#160;minutes before dishing them, take the trout out of water; stun them by a blow on the head; empty and clean them very quickly, and plunge them into the boiling liquid, where they will immediately shrivel, while their skin will break in all directions.</p>
		<p>A few minutes will suffice to cook trout the average weight of which is one-third&#160;<abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr></p>
		<p>Drain them and dish them immediately upon a napkin, with curled-leaf parsley all round. Serve them with a <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#30">Hollandaise</a> sauce or melted butter.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—Fresh-water trout may also be served fried or grilled, but neither of these methods of preparation suits them so well as “à la Meunière” or “au bleu”, which I have given.</p>
		<h2>Soles</h2>
		<p>Sole may be served whole or filleted, and a large number of the recipes given for the whole fish may be adapted to its fillets.</p>
		<p>As a rule, the fillets are made to appear on the menu of a dinner owing to the fact that they dish more elegantly and are more easily served than the whole fish, the latter being generally served at luncheons.</p>
		<p>Nevertheless, in cases where great ceremony is not observed at a dinner, soles may well be served whole, inasmuch as no hard-and-fast rule has ever obtained in this matter.</p>
		<h3 id="818" class="formula">Sole Alice</h3>
		<p>This sole is prepared, or rather its preparation is completed, at the table.</p>
		<p>Have an excellent <a href="01-fonds-de-cuisine.xhtml#11">fish <em>fumet</em> (formula&#160;№11)</a>, short and very white. Trim the sole; put it into a special, deep earthenware dish, the bottom of which should be buttered; pour the <em>fumet</em> over it and poach gently.</p>
		<p>Now send it to the table with a plate containing separate heaps of one finely-chopped onion, a little powdered thyme, and three finely-crushed <em>biscottes</em>.</p>
		<p>In the dining-room the waiter places the dish on a chafer, and, taking off the sole, he raises the fillets therefrom, and places them between two hot plates. He then adds to the cooking-liquor of the sole the chopped onion, which he leaves to cook for a few moments, the powdered thyme and a sufficient quantity of the <em>biscotte</em> raspings to allow of thickening the whole.</p>
		<p>At the last minute he adds six&#160;raw oysters and one&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter divided into small pieces.</p>
		<p>As soon as the oysters are stiff, he returns the fillets of sole to the dish, besprinkles them copiously with the sauce, and then serves them very hot.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—In order to promote the poaching of the soles, more particularly when they are large, the fillets on the upper side of the fish should be slightly separated from the bones. By this means the heat is able to reach the inside of the fish very quickly, and the operation is accelerated.</p>
		<p>The sole is always laid on the dish with its opened side undermost—that is to say, on its back.</p>
		<h3 id="819" class="formula">Sole Mornay</h3>
		<p>Lay the sole on a buttered dish; sprinkle a little fish <em>fumet</em> over it, and add one-half&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter divided into small pieces. Poach gently.</p>
		<p>Coat the bottom of the dish on which the sole is to be served with <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#91">Mornay sauce</a>; drain the fish, lay it on the prepared dish; cover it with the same sauce; sprinkle with grated Gruyère and Parmesan, and glaze at a Salamander.</p>
		<h3 id="820" class="formula">Sole Mornay des Provençaux</h3>
		<p>This sole, which used to be served at the famous restaurant of the “Frères Provençaux”, was prepared, and always may be prepared, as follows:—</p>

		<p>Cover the sole with this sauce; glaze, and garnish each side of the dish with a little heap of a julienne of filleted sole, seasoned, dredged, and tossed in clarified butter at the last moment in order to have it very crisp.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—By substituting a good white wine for the champagne, a variety of dishes may be made, among which may be mentioned: Soles au Chablis, Soles au Sauterne, Sole au Samos, Sole au Chateau Yquem, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>
		<h3 id="822" class="formula">Sole Colbert</h3>
		<p>On the upper side of the fish separate the fillets from the spine, and break the latter in several places. Dip the sole in milk; roll it in flour; treat it <em>à l’anglaise</em>, and roll the separated fillets back a little, so that they may be quite free from the bones.</p>
		<p>Fry; drain on a piece of linen; remove the bones, and fill the resulting space with <a href="#">butter à la Maitre d’Hôtel</a>.</p>

Poach it on a buttered dish with one-sixth pint of white wine, the same quantity of the cooking-liquor of mushrooms, and one&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter cut into small lumps.</p>
		<p>Drain and dish the sole, and cover it with <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#95">Nantua sauce</a>.

		<p>Poach the sole in one-sixth pint of fish <em>fumet</em> and a few tablespoonfuls of the cooking-liquor of mushrooms.</p>
		<p>Drain and dish the sole, surround it with twelve shelled crayfishes’ tails, and coat it with <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#95">Nantua sauce</a>.</p>

		<h2>Fillets of Sole</h2>
		<p>Subject to the kind of dish required, fillets of sole are either kept in their natural state, they are stuffed and folded over, or they are simply folded over without being stuffed, each of which methods of preparation will be specially referred to in the recipes.</p>
		<p>Whatever be the method adopted, always skin the fillets thoroughly; <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, remove the thin membrane which lies beneath the skin, the tendency of which, during the cooking process, is to shrink and thereby disfigure the fillet.</p>
		<p>This done, flatten out the fillets with the broad side of a wet knife, and trim them slightly if necessary. The poaching of fillets of sole must be effected without allowing the cooking-liquor to boil, the object being to prevent the pieces losing their shape. Fillets should also be kept very white.</p>
		<p>In cases where the exact amount of the poaching-liquor is not given, allow one-quarter pint to every four fillets, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, to every sole.</p>

		<h2>Various Preparations of Soles and Fillets of Sole</h2>
		<h3 id="906" class="formula">Mousselines de Soles</h3>
		<p>The directions given under <a href="#797">“<em>Mousselines de</em> Saumon” (formula&#160;№797)</a> apply in all circumstances to <em>Mousselines</em> of Sole. I shall therefore refrain from repeating the recipe, since, the quantities remaining the same, all that is needed is the substitution of the meat of sole for that of salmon. Thus, I shall only state here, by way of reminding the reader, that these excellent preparations admit of all the fish sauces and garnishes, and that they may also be accompanied by all purées of fresh vegetables.</p>
		<h3 id="907" class="formula">Turban de Filets de Soles à la Villaret</h3>
		<p>Raise the fillets of three soles; flatten them slightly with a moistened beater, and trim them very straight on either side.</p>
		<p>Liberally butter a medium-sized savarin-mould. Lay the fillets aslant in this mould, with their tail-ends over-reaching its inner edge and their other ends projecting over its outer edge; slip a fine slice of truffle between each, and let them slightly overlap one another.</p>
		<p>When the mould is completely lined with the fillets of sole, fill it up with lobster <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat. Gently tap the mould on a folded napkin lying on the table, with the object of settling the forcemeat, and then draw the overhanging ends of the fillets across the latter.</p>
		<p>Set to poach in a <em>bain-marie</em> in a moderate oven.</p>
		<p>This done, take the mould out of the <em>bain-marie</em>; let it stand for a few minutes, and then turn it upside-down upon the dish. Leave it to drain; soak up the liquid that has leaked out on to the dish; take off the mould, and moisten the surface of the fillets by means of a small brush dipped in melted butter. The object of this last measure is to glaze the fish and to remove therefrom the froth resulting from its poached albumen.</p>
		<p>Now garnish the centre of the moulding with shrimps’ tails, mushrooms, poached milt, and slices of truffle, the whole cohered by means of <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel sauce</a> finished with lobster butter.</p>
		<p>Send a sauceboat of Bechamel sauce, finished with lobster butter, to the table at the same time as the fish.</p>
		<h3 id="908" class="formula">Turban de Filets de Soles et Saumon Villaret</h3>
		<p>Proceed as in the preceding recipe, but alternate the fillets of sole with very red slices of salmon of the same size as the fillets.</p>
		<p>The combination yields an excellent result, and the varying strips of white and orange which constitute the body of the moulded crown lend sightliness to the dish.</p>
		<p><abbr xml:lang="la" title="Nota bene" class="initialism">N.B.</abbr>—The designation “à la Villaret”, relating to the crown alone, in no wise affects the constituents of the garnish; these may either remain the same as those of the preceding recipe, or may be replaced by something similar. The sauce alone remains unalterable, and this should be a good <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel</a> finished with lobster butter.</p>
		<h3 id="909" class="formula">Turban de Filets de Soles Cardinal</h3>
		<p>For ten people, prepare a <a href="#">timbale crust (formula&#160;№2395)</a> the diameter of which should be greater than the height; line it with fine, short paste, and decorate it with noodle paste.</p>
		<p>Raise the fillets of three medium-sized soles, flatten them slightly; coat them with whiting forcemeat prepared with crayfish butter, and roll them into scroll-form. Also prepare ten small slices of the meat of a medium-sized ordinary or spiny lobster’s tail, ten small grooved and cooked mushrooms, fifteen slices of truffle, and three-quarters pint of <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#69">Cardinal sauce</a> finished with a lobster butter.</p>
		<p>When about to serve, lay the poached, rolled fillets of sole (well drained) in a circle round the bottom of the timbale; put the slices of lobster and the mushrooms in the centre, and cover the whole with Cardinal sauce.</p>
		<p>Set upon the sauce, just over the centre of the timbale, a large, grooved mushroom (cooked and kept very white), and encircle the latter with fifteen slices of truffle.</p>
		<p>Place the timbale, thus garnished, on a folded napkin lying on a dish, and serve at once.</p>

		<h3 id="912" class="formula">Turban de Filets de Soles Carême</h3>
		<p>Flatten the fillets of three medium-sized soles, and trim them neatly.</p>
		<p>Liberally butter a pound-cake mould, and line it with the fillets, placing them side by side with their tails lying round the centre of the bottom of the mould, and their opposite ends projecting above the brim. Press them well, that they may take the shape of the mould.</p>
		<p>Completely coat the fillets with a layer, one-half inch thick, of fish forcemeat.</p>
		<p>Put the mould in the front of the oven for a few minutes in order to poach the forcemeat, which, in adhering to the fillets, gives the required firmness to the timbale.</p>
		<p>When the forcemeat has been poached and is stiff, withdraw the timbale from the oven, and cut off the pieces of fillet that project above the edges of the mould. Fill the timbale to within one-third inch of its brim with a garnish of shrimps and poached oysters and mussels, small button-mushrooms, and slices of truffle, all of which should be cohered with a thick and highly-seasoned <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel sauce</a>. Cover this garnish with the projecting pieces of fillets, already cut off, and close the timbale by means of a thin layer of that forcemeat which served in coating the fillets. Poach for thirty&#160;minutes in a <em>bain-marie</em> and in a moderate oven. After taking the timbale out of the bain-marie, let it stand for a few minutes; overturn it on a round dish; take off the mould; deck it on top with a garland consisting of six little <em>paupiettes</em> of salmon, each stuffed with a crayfish tail, and surmounted by an encrusted crayfish carapace.</p>

		</ol>
		<p>Heat this garnish after having added a few drops of fish <em>fumet</em> to it, and then thicken it with one-half pint of white-wine sauce prepared with paprika.</p>
		<p>Put the above garnish into the timbale, which should be very hot; set the latter on a folded napkin, and serve at once.</p>
		<h3 id="914" class="formula"><span class="subtitle">The preparation of</span> Paupiettes of Fillets of Sole Salmon, <span class="subtitle"><abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></span></h3>
		<p>The <em>paupiettes</em> (or fillets rolled after the manner of a scroll) are served either as entrées like fillets of sole, of which they are but a special kind, or as a garnish. For the second purpose, not only should they be smaller than for the first, but very small fillets are generally selected for the preparation of the <em>paupiettes</em>.</p>
		<p>In order to make <em>paupiettes</em>, first remove the horny film from the outside surfaces of the fillets, and then slightly flatten the latter with the blade of a large knife; trim them on both sides, and coat them on their flayed side with a thin layer of fish forcemeat, truffled or not, in accordance with the requirements.</p>
		<p>Now roll them into scroll-form ; smooth the forcemeat that projects from the top end, and the <em>paupiettes</em> are done.</p>
		<p>Stand them upright in a buttered sautépan to poach, and take care to place them snugly together lest they lose their shape while the operation is in progress. Moisten them with sufficient <a href="01-fonds-de-cuisine.xhtml#11">fish <em>fumet</em> (formula&#160;№11)</a> to cover them; poach them in a moderate oven, and remember, as in the case of fillets of sole, not to let the poaching-liquor boil.</p>
		<p>All the garnishes and sauces suited to fillets of sole likewise obtain with <em>paupiettes</em>, provided the difference in their shape be taken into account when dishing up.</p>
		<p>For salmon <em>paupiettes</em>, cut slices two-thirds inch wide, one- half inch thick, and the length of a fillet of sole, from a skinned fillet of salmon. In view of the unusual fragility of salmon’s flesh, the slices of fillets should be carefully flattened in order to give them the width and thickness of a fillet of sole. This done, spread forcemeat on them, and roll them as explained above.</p>
		<h2>Soles and Fillets of Sole (Cold)</h2>
		<h3 id="915" class="formula">Aspic de Filets de Soles</h3>
		<p>An essential point in the making of an aspic is the clearness of the fish jelly. For a sole aspic, take some white fish aspic, which is at once succulent, limpid, and just sufficiently viscous to allow of its being turned out of a mould without breaking.</p>
		<p>For the purpose under consideration, moulds with plain or decorated borders are generally used, and there are two modes of procedure:—</p>
		<p>For a mould capable of holding one quart, fold twelve small fillets of sole and poach them in butter and lemon juice, taking care to keep them very white. This done, set them to cool under a light weight.</p>
		<p>Pour a few tablespoonfuls of melted fish jelly into the mould, which should be lying amidst broken ice. As soon as the jelly begins to set, decorate it tastefully with pieces (lozenges, crescents, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>) of very black truffle and the poached white of an egg. Capers, tarragon leaves, thin roundels of small radishes, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, may also be used for the purpose of decoration.</p>
		<p>When this part of the procedure has been satisfactorily effected, sprinkle a few drops of the same jelly over the decorat- ing particles, in order to fix them and prevent their shifting during the subsequent stages of the process. Now add enough melted jelly to cover the bottom of the mould with a layer one&#160;inch&#160;thick, and leave this to set.</p>
		<p>On this set jelly, arrange the six fillets of sole ; let their tail- ends overlap, and cover them with jelly. Continue adding coat upon coat of jelly until the thickness covering the fillets measures about one-half&#160;inch.</p>
		<p>Now arrange the remaining fillets in the reverse order, and fill up the mould with cold, melted jelly. Leave to cool for one hour.</p>
		<p>When about to serve, quickly dip the mould in a saucepan of hot water; wipe it, and turn out the aspic upon a folded napkin lying on a dish.</p>
		<h3 id="916" class="formula"><span class="subtitle">Another Method of Preparing</span> Aspic de Filets de Soles</h3>
		<p>Coat ten fine fillets of sole with a thin layer of truffled fish forcemeat finished with crayfish butter, and roll them round a little rod of truffle, twice as thick as an ordinary penholder. Tie these <em>paupiettes</em>, once or twice round, with cotton; poach them very gently in fish <em>fumet</em> and cool them on ice. Take a border-mould, even if possible; pour therein a few tablespoonfuls of melted fish jelly, and then rock it about on broken ice, with the object of evenly coating it with a thin layer of the jelly.</p>
		<p>This operation is technically called “clothing the mould”.</p>
		<p>Decorate the bottom of the mould as explained above; fix the decorating particles, and cover them with a layer one-half inch thick of fish jelly.</p>
		<p>After having properly trimmed the ends of the <em>paupiettes</em>, cut them into roundels one-half inch thick; set these upright against the sides of the mould, keeping them close together; add a few drops of melted jelly to fix the roundels, and as soon as this has set, add a further quantity, sufficient to completely cover them.</p>
		<p>As soon as this jelly sets, repeat the operation with the <em>paupiette</em> roundels and the jelly, and do so again and again until the mould is filled. For turning out the aspic, proceed as directed above.</p>
		<h3 id="917" class="formula">Bordure de Filets de Soles à l’Italienne</h3>
		<p>Line a border-mould with jelly; <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, coat its bottom and sides with a thin layer of fish jelly, rocking it upon ice as already explained.</p>
		<p>Now fill it, two-thirds full, with a garnish consisting of a <em>julienne</em> of cold, poached fillets of sole, a <em>julienne</em> of truffles (two&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> per two filleted soles), and a <em>julienne</em> of capsicum (one&#160;and&#160;one-half&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> per two filleted soles). Fill up the mould with melted fish jelly, and leave the latter to set.</p>
		<p>When about to serve, turn out the mould upon a little, low cushion of rice, lying on a dish, and set an <a href="#">Italian salad</a> in the centre.</p>
		<p>Serve a <a href="04-cold-sauces-and-compound-butters.xhtml#126">Mayonnaise sauce</a> with this dish.</p>
		<h3 id="918" class="formula">Filets de Soles Calypso</h3>
		<p>Flatten the fillets, and roll them into <em>paupiettes</em> around little rods of wood two-thirds inch thick. Lay the <em>paupiettes</em> in a buttered sautépan, with their joined sides undermost, and poach them in very clear fish <em>fumet</em> and lemon juice, taking care to keep them very white.</p>
		<p>Let them cool, and remove the pieces of wood, whereupon they will have the appearance of rings.</p>
		<p>Take as many small tomatoes as there are <em>paupiettes</em>; cut them in two at a point two-thirds of their height below their stem-end; empty, and peel them. Set a <em>paupiette</em>, upright, in each tomato; fill the centre with <a href="#">crayfish <em>mousse</em></a> combined with crayfishes’ tails in dice; lay a round piece of milt (stamped out with a cutter, poached, and cold) on each, and, finally, the shelled tail of a crayfish on each roundel of milt.</p>
		<p>Arrange the tomatoes in a circle round a dish; surround them with little triangles of white fish jelly, and garnish the centre of the dish with the same fish jelly, chopped.</p>

		<p>Set them, tail end uppermost, against a <em>mousse</em> of milt with horse-radish, moulded in a narrow dome-mould, which should have been coated with fish jelly and besprinkled with chopped coral.</p>

		<h3 id="921" class="formula">Dominos de Filets de Soles</h3>
		<p>Select some fine, fleshy fillets; slightly flatten them; poach them in a little of the cooking-liquor of mushrooms, some lemon juice and butter, and set them to cool under a light weight. When the fillets are cold, trim them and cut them into regular rectangles the size of dominoes.</p>
		<p>Coat the rectangles with a maigre, <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#72">white chaud-froid sauce</a> decorate them in imitation of dominoes, with little spots of truffle; glaze them with cold, melted fish jelly, and put them aside.</p>
		<p>Pound the trimmings of the fish together with their weight of caviare, and rub the whole through a fine sieve. Add to this preparation half its weight of highly-coloured jelly, and leave it to set in a somewhat deep and moderately-oiled tray, the thickness of the preparation on the tray being not greater than that of a fillet of sole.</p>
		<p>When the jelly is set, cut it into rectangles exactly the same size as the prepared dominoes, and then, by means of a little melted, cold jelly, fix the diminoes of sole to the rectangles just prepared.</p>
		<p>Put some chopped jelly in the centre of the dish, and on this lay the dominoes in a muddled heap.</p>
		<h3 id="922" class="formula">Filets de Soles Froids Dressés sur Mousses</h3>
		<p>What I pointed out above, I repeat here for the reader’s guidance—namely, that fillets of sole may be prepared after all the recipes given for trout (<a href="#813">formula&#160;№813</a>).
		<p>As the fillets of sole in this dish remain very conspicuous, it is advisable to keep them very white in the poaching. Set them to cool under a light weight, and decorate them in a way that will be in keeping with the <em>mousse</em> on which they are dished. This <em>mousse</em> is set on a special dish, as already explained, and the decorated fillets are laid upon it and covered with melted jelly.</p>
		<p>For the variation of mousses, see the table given under <a href="#814">formula&#160;№814</a>.</p>
		<h3 id="923" class="formula">Turbot</h3>
		<p>Turbot is generally served boiled, accompanied by freshly-cooked, floury potatoes, and the cases are exceptional when, cooked in this way, it is dished with any other garnish.</p>
		<p>All fish sauces may be served with turbot. When, for the sake of variety, or in pursuance of the consumer’s wishes, turbot has to be braised or garnished, it is best to select a medium-sized fish, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, one weighing from eight to twelve <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, thick, very fleshy, and white.</p>
		<p>Unless expressly ordered, it is best to avoid surrounding the piece with its garnish. Preferably, send the latter to the table in a separate dish, as also the sauce. By this means the service is expedited, and, more important still, the fish is quite hot when it reaches the table. It is granted that the sight of a dish containing a fine, richly garnished and taste- fully arranged piece is flattering to the host, but it would be a pity that the quality of the fish should thereby sufifer, more particularly as the gourmet is not satisfied with sightliness alone.</p>
		<p>I explained at the beginning of this chapter, under <a href="#776">“Boiled Fish” (formulas&#160;№776&#160;and №779)</a>, the details relating to this method of cooking, especially with regard to its application to turbot. For the braising and garnishing of turbot, the reader is begged to refer to the recipes concerned with chicken-turbot. These recipes may be applied to turbot, provided the difference in the size of the fish be taken into account in reference to the time allowed for braising and the quantities of the garnishing ingredients.</p>
		<h3 id="924" class="formula">Cold Turbot</h3>
		<p>Whether whole or sliced, cold turbot makes an excellent dish, if the fish have not been cooked too long beforehand. It will be found that turbot, especially when sliced, tends to harden, crumple, and lose its flavour while cooling. It is therefore of the greatest importance that the fish should have just cooled after cooking, and that the cooking-liquor should have barely time to set; otherwise the evil effects of cooling, mentioned above, will surely ensue. When served, just cooled,with one of the cold sauces suited to fish, turbot can vie in delicacy even with such fish as salmon or trout, which are usually served cold.</p>
		<h3 id="925" class="formula">Turbotins (Chicken-Turbots)</h3>
		<p>Turbotins (chicken-turbots) may rank among the most delicate and nicest of fish. Their varying sizes allow of their being served either for three, four, or ten, or twelve people; they are, moreover, tender and white, and they lend themselves to quite a vast number of culinary preparations.</p>
		<p>They may be served boiled, like the turbot; grilled; à la Meunière; fried; <em>au gratin</em>, like the soles; or braised, like the salmon and the trout. They are most often served whole, garnished and with sauce; but, in order to simplify the process, they may be filleted, the fillets being poached and dished with a garnish and the selected sauce.</p>
		<p>Whatever be the method of preparing the chicken-turbot, whether it be boiled, poached, or braised, the spine should always be cut in one or two places. The gash should be just in the middle of the back where the flesh is thickest, and the fillets on either side of the gash should be partly separated from the bone. The object of this measure is to prevent deformation during the cooking process and, also, to precipitate the latter.</p>
		<h3 id="926" class="formula">Turbotin à l’Admiral</h3>
		<p>Gash the back of the fish, and partly separate the under fillets from the bo</p>nes. Lay it on a grill, and moisten, sufficiently to cover it, with previously-cooked <em>court-bouillon</em> with Sauterne wine. As soon as the <em>court-bouillon</em> boils, allow the fish to cook ten or twelve minutes for every two&#160;<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of its weight.</p>
		<p>This done, drain it; dish it, and coat it twice with melted, red butter.</p>
		<p>Now surround it with the following garnish, which should be in proportion to the size of the fish, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="videlicet">viz.</abbr>, little heaps of large mussels and oysters, prepared <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#108">à la Villeroy</a>, and fried at the time of dishing; small patties of crayfish tails; large mushroom-heads grooved and cooked, and slices of truffle.</p>

In the case of a chicken-turbot weighing two and one-half <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, moisten with one-third pint of white wine and one-quarter pint of fish <em>fumet</em>.</p>
		<p>Finely mince two medium-sized onions, and toss them in butter until they have acquired a yellow colour.</p>
		<p>Peel, press and mince three tomatoes, and add thereto three large, raw, sliced mushrooms. Cut two mild capsicums into strips.</p>
		<p>Spread the onion on the chicken-turbot; put the tomatoes and the sliced mushrooms on top, and upon these arrange the grilled strips of mild capsicum. Besprinkle moderately with raspings; lay one&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter, cut into small pieces, on the top, and set to cook gently in the oven.</p>
		<p>Allow thirty minutes for the cooking. By reducing the moistening-liquor, which has perforce absorbed some of the gelatinous properties of the fish, the leason forms of itself.</p>

		<h3 id="936" class="formula">Turbotin Soufflé à la Reynière</h3>
		<p>Lay the chicken-turbot on its belly, and make two gashes in its back, on either side of the spine, from the head to the tail. Completely separate the fillets from the bones; cut the spine at both ends; carefully raise it from the underlying, ventral fillets, and entirely remove it.</p>
		<p>Season the inside of the fish, and garnish it with enough fish <em>mousseline</em> forcemeat to give it a rounded appearance. Close in the forcemeat by drawing the two separated fillets over it; turn the piece over, and lay it on a well-buttered, deep, oval dish, the size of which should be in proportion to that of the chicken-turbot.</p>
		<p>Poach it gently, almost dry, with lid on, in fish <em>fumet</em> and the cooking-liquor of mushrooms mixed, <abbr xml:lang="la" title="id est" class="initialism">i.e.</abbr>, two-thirds pint of the one and one-third pint of the other. This done, dish it carefully, and lay a row of grooved and white mushroom-heads down the centre of it. On either side put some very white, poached milt, alternating the latter with whole anchovy fillets, in such wise as to form an oval enframing the row of mushrooms.</p>
		<p>Send to the table, separately, a sauce composed of <a href="#">Soubise cullis</a> and <a href="03-the-small-compound-sauces.xhtml#111">white-wine sauce</a>, in the proportion of one-third and two-thirds respectively, combined with the reduced cooking-liquor of the chicken-turbot.</p>

		<p>Coat the fish with lobster butter, made as red as possible, from the carcass of the lobster whose meat has been used for the forcemeat.</p>
		<p>From head to tail and down the centre of the fish lay a row of fine slices of truffle, letting them overlap each other slightly.</p>
		<p>Frame the row of truffle with two lines of very white, poached oysters, so placed as to form a regular oval.</p>
		<p>Send to the table, separately, a fine <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#28">Béchamel sauce</a> seasoned with cayenne.</p>
		<h3 id="938" class="formula">Cold Chicken-Turbot</h3>
		<p>My remarks relative to cold turbot apply here with even greater force, for chicken-turbots are particularly well suited to cold dishing.</p>
		<p>The chicken-turbots to be served cold should not be too small ; the best for the purpose would be those weighing four&#160;<abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> or more.</p>
		<p>In dismissing the subject I can but recommend cold chicken-turbot as a dish admitting of the most tasteful arrangement and decoration</p>
		<h2>Lobster (Homard)</h2>
		<p>Whereas the ordinary lobster is a very favourite dish with English gourmets, the spiny kind has scarcely any vogue. This is no doubt accounted for by the fact that the former is not only very plentiful, but also of excellent quality, while the latter is comparatively scarce.</p>
		<h3 id="939" class="formula">Homard à l’américaine</h3>
		<p>The first essential condition is that the lobster should be alive. Sever and slightly crush the claws, with the view of withdrawing their meat after cooking ; cut the tail into sections split the carapace in two lengthwise, and remove the queen (a little bag near the head containing some gravel). Put aside, on a plate, the intestines and the coral, which will be used in the finishing of the sauce, and season the pieces of lobster with salt and pepper.</p>
		<p>Put these pieces into a sautdpan containing one-sixth pint of oil and one oz. ofJautter, both very hot. Fry them over an open fireunnl the meat has stiffened well and the carapace is of a fine red colour.</p>
		<p>Then remove all grease by tilting the sautépan on its side with its lid on; sprinkle the pieces of lobster with two chopped shallots and one crushed clove of garlic; add one-third pint of white wine, one-quarter pint of fish <em>fumet</em>, a small glassful of burnt brandy, one tablespoonful of melted <a href="01-fonds-de-cuisine.xhtml#15">meat glaze</a>, three small, fresh, pressed, and chopped tomatoes (or, failing fresh tomatoes, two&#160;tablespoonfuls of tomato purée), a pinch of <em>concassed</em> parsley, and a very little cayenne. Cover the sautépan, and set to cook in the oven for eighteen or twenty minutes.</p>
		<p>This done, transfer the pieces of lobster to a dish; withdraw the meat from the section of the tail and the claws, and put them in a timbale; set upright thereon the two halves of the carapace, and let them lie against each other. Keep the whole hot.</p>
		<p>Now reduce the cooking-sauce of the lobster to one-third pint ; add tKereto the intestines and the chopped coral, together with a piece of butter the size of a walnut; set to cook for a moment, and pass through a strainer.</p>
		<p>Put this cullis into a vegetable-pan; heat it without letting it boil, and add, away from the fire, three&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of butter cut into small pieces.</p>
		<p>Pour this sauce over the pieces of lobster which have been kept hot, and sprinkle the whole with a pinch of <em>concassed</em> and scalded parsley.</p>
		<h3 id="940" class="formula">Homard à la Bordelaise</h3>
		<p>Section the live lobster as directed above.</p>
		<p>Stiffen the meat and colour the carapace in a sautépan with two&#160;<abbr title="ounce">oz.</abbr> of clarified butter. When the meat is quite stiff and the carapace is red, pour away two-thirds of the butter. Then add two tablespoonfuls of chopped shallots, a crushed piece of garlic the size of a pea, one-sixth pint of white wine, three tablespoonfuls of burnt brandy, and reduce the whole to half. Complete with one-half pint of fish <em>fumet</em>, one-third pint of <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#24">maigre Espagnole</a>, one-quarter pint of <a href="02-the-leading-warm-sauces.xhtml#29">tomato sauce</a>, one small faggot, one pinch of salt, and a very little cayenne.</p>
		<p>Put the lid on, and set to cook for one-quarter hour.</p>
		<p>Take the meat from the sections of the tail and the claws, as in the case of the preparation à l’américaine ; put these into a small saut^pan, and keep them hot. Add the intestines and the chopped coral, reduce the sauce to one-third pint; pass it through a strainer, and pour it over the pieces of lobster.
