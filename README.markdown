This is my occasional hobby of turning a rather ratty <abbr title="Portable Document Format" class="initialism">P.D.F.</abbr> of the <time>1907</time> abridged English translation of Escoffier’s [<span lang="fr">Le guide culinaire</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_guide_culinaire) into a serviceable electronic book which will allow me to flit at will through its pages.

I have no timetable for completion.
