This is my occasional hobby of turning a rather ratty <abbr title="Portable Document Format" class="initialism">P.D.F.</abbr> of the <time>1907</time> abridged English translation of Escoffier’s [<span lang="fr">Le guide culinaire</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_guide_culinaire) into a serviceable electronic book which will allow me to flit at will through its pages.

At any particular time this repository should be ready to download and compress into an ePub with a few missing chapters and a few dead links. Links to content that has not yet been added are in the format `<a href="#"`. Links to the glossary will be created once all the content has been added.
